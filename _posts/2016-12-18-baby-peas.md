title: Baby Peas!
---

Our second attempt at germinating peas had better results this time. We lost about half of the peas to mold, but the rest of the peas started to sprout quite healthily. Separating the moldy peas from the healthy ones and rinsing off the mold seemed to help quite a bit.

Yesterday, Renny and I decided to move the sprouting peas from the moist napkin to some peat germination pods that we had left over from trying to start our outdoor vegetable garden. The pea babys seem very happy in their new home.

We also went ahead and ordered the hydroponic nutrients and airstones that we'll need for our first hydroponic setup. They should be here Tuesday. That will give the baby peas plenty of time to get more established before transferring them to the hydroponic system.
