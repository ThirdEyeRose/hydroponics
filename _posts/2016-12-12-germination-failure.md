title: Germination Failure
---

Our first batch of sugar snap peas failed to germinate last week. We had been using some leftover soil from a terrarium that we were cleaning out, not thinking about the history that soil has had so far. After these starts started to mold, we ended up tossing those seeds out and starting fresh.

This time, we're using a method that is so tried and true that elementary schools use it when teaching kids about seeds. We moistened a paper towel, wrung it out, and packed a new set of seeds in it before putting it into a ziploc bag to keep in the moisture. We did this on Sunday and there have been no starts yet, but I'm hopeful.

If this doesn't work out, we still have a couple of dozen seeds from this pack and I think I'll try a method of soaking the seeds in a nutrient solution before putting them into a germinating medium.
