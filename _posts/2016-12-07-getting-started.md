# Getting Started

Renny and I have been dreaming for a long time about setting up a hydroponic garden in our house. We've got so much space that goes completely unused and the garden is so much work to handle despite our love of growing things.

I had been trying to budget out a basic hydroponic system for a while, but despite the low cost of these systems, there always seemed to be something more important to use that money for. This past weekend, Renny helped me go from the dreaming phase to actually putting something together. She showed me that with a bunch of random stuff that we had lying around the house, we could actually jury-rig our first planter if we just purchased an air pump and some nutrients.

Over the weekend we set up some egg carton starters with some sugar snap peas that we had in storage and watered them in a brownie tin that my mom left with us. None of the seeds have started to grow yet, but I'm fairly hopeful.

The air pump that we ordered also arrived today. This air pump looks small, but it is quite the beast and makes quite the racket. We may have tofind some way to suppress the noise that it makes if we're going to have it running between my office and our bedroom.
